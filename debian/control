Description: Debian packager for Sony PlayStation BIOS images
 Most PSX emulators require a genuine PlayStation BIOS; even those that
 don't (because they come with an emulated BIOS) will usually work better
 with one.
 .
 This utility makes it possible to build your own personal Debian package
 of a Sony PlayStation BIOS image.
