 don't (because they come with an emulated BIOS) will usually work better
 with one.  Some BIOS versions work better than others; you can install
 more than one package concurrently.

 You should only download this package if you own a Sony PlayStation, model
 %ROM%.  The BIOS included is copyrighted by Sony Computer Entertainment.
