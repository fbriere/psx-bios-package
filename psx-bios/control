Description: Sony PlayStation BIOS (${local:Model})
 This package contains a dump of the Sony PlayStation model ${local:Model} BIOS.
 .
 Most PSX emulators require a genuine PlayStation BIOS; even those that
 don't (because they come with an emulated BIOS) will usually work better
 with one.  Some BIOS versions work better than others; you can install
 more than one package concurrently.
 .
 You should only download this package if you own a Sony PlayStation, model
 ${local:Model}.  The BIOS included is copyrighted by Sony Computer Entertainment.
 Download and use at your own risk.
